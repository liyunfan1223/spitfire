## Building

### Dependencies
Spiftire requires `tcmalloc` and Intel's `tbb` library. To install the dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04, run the following command: 
```bash
sudo apt install libgoogle-perftools-dev libtbb-dev
```
### Compilation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zxjcarrot/spitfire.git
cd spitfire
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. 
make -j 16 ycsb
```
This generates a `ycsb` exectuable in build directory.

### Hardware Setup for Logging and NVM buffer pool.
Spitfire implements classic redo/undo logging and it optimizes logging by placing the log buffer and the log files on NVM. Spitfire places the NVM buffer on NVM-backed filesystem using `mmap`. Therefore, you need to configure the Optane DIMM in `app-direct` mode and mount an `fsdax` mode file system on top of the device. Check out this [tutorial](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/configuring-persistent-memory-for-file-system-direct-access-dax) on how to configure the device and the file system. Once the file system is configured and mounted, create two directories for storing NVM log files and buffer. Then you should pass them to the `ycsb` program using `-J` and `-P` options. Make sure you have the permission to read and write to the files in these directories.
### Buffer Pool Mode
The buffer pool can be configured into 4 modes (2 three-tier modes and 2 two-tier modes) using `-B` or `--bp_mode` options.
#### DRAM-NVM-SSD mode
In this three-tier mode, real NVM is used for the middle buffer. This mode requires `-P` option. For example,
```bash
./ycsb -k 512 -T 7480 -Y 14960 -I -U 30 -s  -J /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_wal/  -B 1 -D /mnt/optane/spitfire_db/ -P /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_buf/ -u 0 -d 360 -U 60 
```
This first loads a 1 GB `YCSB`  database. It writes a nvm log to `/mnt/myPMem/spitfire_wal/`. The NVM buffer is stored in `/mnt/myPMem/spitfire_buf/`. The database files are stored in `/mnt/optane/spitfire_db/`. The DRAM/NVM buffer capacities are set to 116MB and 233MB respectively. After the database is loaded, it warms up the buffers for 60s and then executes YCSB readonly workload for 360s using one thread. You can also use `-L` option to skip the loading process and reload an existing database.
#### DRAM-NVM(DRAM-emulated)-SSD mode. 
In this three-tier mode, the middle buffer emulates NVM using DRAM.
```bash
./ycsb -k 512 -T 7480 -Y 14960 -I -U 30 -s  -J /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_wal/  -B 0 -D /mnt/optane/spitfire_db/ -u 0 -d 360 -U 60 
```
This is similar to the first mode except that the `-P` option is omitted as it does not use NVM. 
#### DRAM-SSD mode
This is a classic 2-tier configuration where DRAM buffer is used to cache a set of hot pages. For example,
```bash
./ycsb -k 512 -T 7480 -I -U 30 -s  -J /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_wal/  -B 2 -D /mnt/optane/spitfire_db/ -u 0 -d 360 -U 60 
```
This uses a 233MB of DRAM buffer on top of the database. 
#### NVM-SSD mode
In this two-tier mode, a persistent NVM buffer is used to cache hot pages. Different from DRAM-SSD mode, writes to pages in NVM buffer are persistent and requries no dirty page flush except for evictions. For example,
```bash
./ycsb -k 512 -Y 14960 -I -U 30 -s  -J /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_wal/ -P /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_buf/ -B 3 -D /mnt/optane/spitfire_db/ -u 0 -d 360 -U 60 
```
This uses a 233MB of NVM buffer on top of the database. The NVM buffer is stored in `/mnt/myPMem/spitfire_buf/`.

### Lazy Migration Policy
By default, Spitfire uses Eager migration policy. You can use `-Q`, `-W`, `-E`, `-R` to adjust the migration probabilities regarding DRAM and NVM. For example
```bash
./ycsb -k 512 -T 7480 -Y 14960 -I -U 30 -s  -J /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_wal/  -B 1 -D /mnt/optane/spitfire_db/ -P /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_buf/ -u 0 -d 360 -U 60  -Q 0.1 -W 0.1 -E 0.2 -R 1
```
This configuration uses the Lazy migration policy for DRAM-NVM-SSD mode described in the paper. 

### Adaptive Data Migration
To try out simulated-annealing, use `-A` option.
```bash
./ycsb -k 512 -T 1496 -Y 14960 -I -U 30 -s  -J /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_wal/  -B 1 -P /mnt/myPMem/spitfire_nvm_buf -D /mnt/optane/spitfire_db/ -u 0  -d 360 -U 6  -R 1 -A -L
```
This instructs Spitfire to start from an eager policy and gradually tune the policy over the duration of the benchmark.
### HYMEM optimizations
Spitfire codebase includes two HYMEM optimizations:
* Fine-grained Page Loading
* Mini Page

For the first optimization, the loading granularity is defined in `include/config.h`. By default, the loading granularity is 16384 which is a full page. You can change this number and recompile to enable this optimization.

For the Mini Page optimization, you can use the `-M` knob.
## Caveats

- The code is only tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with gcc 9.3.0 toolchains.
- The recovery protocol is not fully implemented.
